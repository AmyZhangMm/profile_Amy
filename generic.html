								Hi Everyone!
	
								My name is Amy and currently I am participating in the appreticeship phase of a government program - Junior Full Stack Developer.
								The experience of a full-time bootcamp in the first three months of this program gave me a completely understanding of the construction of a website from the front end	
								to the back end. And through the joint efforts of myself and the team, we created our own website - HappyTingkat, and I completed the design and
								programming of "About Us" and "Login in" pages in this project. </p>
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/lady in codes.jpg" alt=""/></div>

								<p>In July of this year since I joined a local IT company as an intern, I participated in a project as a role of Business Analyst. Our client is a non-profit organization, and 
								the target is to help them complete the digital transformation of routine operation with the management of donation, event and volunteer. 
								During this 4 months, I learned the project documents with the internal system tarining materials to minimise my project knowledge gap. 
								We always maintained actively and close communication with client and completed the signing of FSD according to the schedule one and half month later since I joined.
								Although, we had some delays in the UAT stage, but these also became my valuable experience in other projects in the future. Currently our project is progressing smoothly towards the go-live stage.
								<br><br>
								I am very grateful as I fulfilled the task of BA very conscientiously, and I was recommended by the project manager of the current project to take the position of junior frond end developer in another project of his. 
								This is what I've always wanted to do. At present, we are connecting with clients to accurately capture their needs by explaining the workflow of the system to them. I firmly believe that in the last month of my internship, 
								I will learn and understand my responsibilities as a front-end developer in the project and any difficulties I will encounter. However, I look forward to it as since the first day of the internship, 
								I knew that my interest and expertise lie in the design and construction of front-end websites. Maybe my current programming skill is not the best, but I will try to be one of them. Isn't the journey just beginning! 
								At present, the small goal I set for myself on programming is: to consolidate the knowledge of javascript and react again during my free time outside of two projects, and try to complete some mini projects by myself to become more proficient in related skills.
								Recently. I am self-studying related knowledge at freeCodeCamp.org and linkedin Learning Center.</p>
